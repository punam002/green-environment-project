        Plants use CO₂ in photosynthesis and release O₂ as a byproduct. This process, known as photosynthesis,
        converts light energy into chemical energy in the form of sugars, using carbon dioxide and water as inputs.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Inputs:</strong><br>
        Plants take in carbon dioxide from the atmosphere through tiny pores called stomata, primarily located
        on the underside of leaves. They also absorb water from the soil through their roots, which is then
        transported to the leaves.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Light Energy:</strong><br>
        Chlorophyll, a pigment found in plant cells, absorbs light energy from the sun.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Conversion:</strong><br>
        This light energy is used to transform carbon dioxide and water into glucose (a type of sugar) and oxygen.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Outputs:</strong><br>
        The glucose is used as food for the plant, while the oxygen is released back into the atmosphere.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Process:</strong><br>
        Photosynthesis can be summarized as: <br>
        <code>6CO₂ + 6H₂O → C₆H₁₂O₆ + 6O₂</code><br>
        This equation indicates that six molecules of carbon dioxide and six molecules of water are converted into
        one molecule of glucose and six molecules of oxygen.
